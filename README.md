# Project-main
Designed to be a garage sale style project with the ability buy at set price or make offers.  
This project will be a reflection of my developing skill set in mastering html, css and javascript.  It will be designed as a garage sale, with items 
grouped some by type some this and that.  my goal is to not only allow the purchase of items as in the web site I created "Retirementcrafts.com" which
is up and running but not currently being actively updated but still functional, but to enable and offer option if the visitor was at the "garage sale" and wanted to make an offer.
